Differential Pressure Transducal System:
PTop, PBottom, PBallValve (record but ignore).
Get measure from PTop, look at saturion table (plug in). Y=mx+b. Pressure corresponds to density.
Do not do for PBottom.
PBottom - PTop (raw value).
Then a calculation, plug difference and density into formula to get estimated mass. 

Display PTop, PBottom, Estimated Mass.

LoadCell: Also measures oxidizer mass.
Zero-Button like a scale.
Concern with pressure getting too high. Color changes when too high.
RealTime - initial measurement vs time. DISPLAY
Below maybe display how many lbs of oxide needed for optimal.

TC Thermocouples: Value vs Time plot. Talk to Courtney about whether I need to do calculations or they are modifying raw data. 
CRITICAL MEASUREMENTS: 75 degrees F. 70 threshold. 74 red.
Change color of displayed values when getting close to critical values. 

Solenoid Valve: On or off. Normally off: no power, then open. Power, then closed. 

Motorized Ball Valves: Display the state of the valve. Dialog (Opening, closed, open...?). Talk to Courtney.
